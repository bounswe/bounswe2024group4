## Milestone Review

### [Pre-release version of the software](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group4/releases/tag/customer-milestone-1)

### A summary of the project status and any changes that are planned for moving forward.
We are developing a fitness and diet forum targeting fitness enthusiasts. So far, we have created scenarios and mockups, defined our requirements, and in the design phase, we have developed sequence diagrams, class diagrams, and use case diagrams. In the implementation phase, we have initialized our frontend, backend and mobile parts. Then, we have successfully implemented our distinguishing features‚Äîmeal creation and exercise program creation‚Äîmeal creation on the web and exercise program creation on mobile.

Next, we will implement standard forum features such as login and profile functionalities. Following that, we‚Äôll integrate APIs to assist with meal and exercise program creation. We plan to expand our exercise pool with more comprehensive exercises like cardio. We‚Äôre also considering adding a tracking mechanism for both exercises and meals, a feature to demonstrate or explain how exercises are performed, and improvements to make the meal-adding process easier for super users.

### Customer Feedback and Reflections
#### A summary of the customer feedback and reflections from demo
* We should include both macronutrients and micronutrients of the food in the nutrients tab.
* Cardio exercises can be added to the exercises list, they do not necessarily just weight exercises for one specific muscle group.
* Nutrients are scaled (they are all in grams), it would be better if we also scale ingredients as well so that they will have the same unit.
* There should be a mechanism for keeping track of the meals just like the exercises. Users should be able to keep track of what they ate, how many grams of which nutrient and how many calories they got from a meal.
* We should add a "how to" part inside of exercises so that the users will know how to do that exercise, what not to do and what to be careful about.
* Users should be able to keep track of each exercise, not the whole exercise program as a package.

For communication, we utilized group **WhatsApp** chats for general team discussions and team-specific groups.  
This streamlined conversations among different technology-focused subteams.  
Additionally, we used **Discord** for course-related notifications, ensuring timely updates for all members.  
Meetings were held via **Zoom**, while face-to-face evaluations took place during lab hours, allowing for in-depth discussions and feedback.

* #### Documentation and Knowledge Sharing
We relied on **GitHub Wiki** for documentation and knowledge sharing.  
This played a crucial role in maintaining a centralized repository of project information.  
This resource was invaluable for onboarding new team members and ensuring that everyone had access to the necessary documentation.

* #### Conclusion
In conclusion, the tools and processes we implemented were instrumental in managing the complexities of our project.  
The task sharing was executed in a very organized manner.  
This allowed each subteam to focus on their specific areas while ensuring that everyone was aligned with the overall project goals.  
This structure not only promoted effective collaboration among team members but also fostered a culture of mutual control.  
Team members regularly reviewed each other's work through the process of revising and merging pull requests.  
This practice enhanced code quality and reinforced collective ownership of the project.

Furthermore, our communication was robust and effective, facilitated by various platforms such as WhatsApp and Discord.  
These tools enabled timely updates and swift responses, which were critical in maintaining momentum throughout the project.  
Regular meetings via Zoom and face-to-face evaluations during lab hours further strengthened our team dynamics.  
These interactions allowed for in-depth discussions and real-time feedback.  

Overall, the combination of well-organized task management, strong collaboration, and effective communication significantly contributed to our ability to deliver high-quality results.

Responsibilities:
I was responsible for creating exercise program scenario, reviewing the backend initialization, creating the app structure inside backend folder, creating class diagram and reviewing authentication in the backend for sign-up, login, and logout functionalities and creating exercise program. Additionally, i added the ReadMe file for backend 

#### Main contributions:
- Create the general structure of Backend: In order to be able to work on it together without potential conflicts, I have separated the backend apps like use_auth, exercise_program, diet_program etc
- DockerFile: Finalized the Docker File, getting it ready for deployment
- Project Evaluation: Evaluated the status of our deliverables, analyzed their impact on the project plan, and provided reflections to guide future development.
