### Description of the Standard Being Utilized
This is documented [here](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group4/wiki/W3C-Standard-Selection-%E2%80%90-Activity-Streams)

## Testing
### Test Strategy

#### 1. Development Phase:
##### Backend
- Postman and HTML templates to test the requests and responses
##### Frontend
- Directly in the browser or local development environment, where UI and the behavior of components are observed.
##### Mobile
- Within the mobile app on simulator or emulator. The focus is on observing how UI is and components react.

#### 2. Integration Phase:
##### Backend
- Unit tests to check the endpoints in a more comprehensive manner
- Test the integrated front-end on a local machine
##### Frontend
- Unit tests to validate the functionality of individual frontend components, ensuring each part works as expected in isolation.
- Test the integrated frontend on a local machine to check the overall UI and interactions, ensuring everything functions correctly when connected to the backend.
##### Mobile
- Implement unit tests to validate the logic and behavior of mobile components, checking each feature individually.
- Test the mobile app on a simulator or emulator to ensure the UI and features work as expected, focusing on responsiveness, navigation, and data interactions.

#### 3. After Deployment:
- Apply and report end-to-end, user tests covering all features to make sure that everything is working correctly.

* User tests that cover the following features will be created: 
  * Exercise creation
  * Meal creation
  * Sign-up/Login
  * Follow/unfollow
  * Create Post
  * Like Post
  * Search 
  * Edit Profile
  * Comment
  * Bookmark/Unbookmark
  * See Others' Profile 
  * Leaderboard
  * Rating an exercise/meal
  * Comment

### Unit Test Reports
#### Backend
We ran 55 tests. 26 tests passed and 29 tests failed.

The reason for that is we had to send user information as an argument in the requests due to a problem we had with CSRF tokens. However, the tests are created considering the true-practice solution which is sending user information secretly in the request and we did not change the tests after this update in the code, the reason behind the big number of failures is this. Before that problem the tests were yielding 100% percent success.

Below we provided the terminal commands we used to generate the test reports. Also, you can see comprehensive screenshots of the report. Below the images you can also see the reason of each failure. We couldn't provide the report directly because it requires hosting.

## Evaluation

### Customer Feedback and Reflections

- Exercise instructions should be shorter.
- Instructions should have media such as images and videos that shows how to do an exercise as at the moment only text information is provided.
- Rating actions should have sanity checks.
- Workout creation should have sanity checks.
- Commenting on workouts should be possible.

### Evaluation of the status of deliverables and its impact on your project plan (reflection)

* #### Pre-release of our software

Frontend and backend parts of our software accomplished vast majority of our planned second milestone targets, including the leaderboard page, exercise creation and rating. We couldn't implement some of these in our mobile application, which will be addressed before the third milestone. Excluding this, we are on track with our project plan.

#### Evaluation of tools and processes you have used to manage your team project

* DigitalOcean 

We are continuing to use DigitalOcean as our cloud provider, even though now the project consumes more resources as frontend and backend is connected the machine we spinned up before Milestone I is still working well.

* Testing frameworks

In this milestone we added unit tests to our repository. For backend we used Django's own testing framework while we used Jest for both frontend and mobile. We found each of these frameworks easy to use and we are pleased with our decision to use them.

* Swagger

In this milestone, we integrated Swagger into our project to streamline API documentation and improve collaboration between team members. Swagger allowed us to create an interactive and detailed API documentation that accurately represents the functionality of our backend endpoints. It provided a user-friendly interface where team members could easily explore, test, and understand API behaviors without needing to inspect code directly.
## Individual Contributions
<details>
<summary>Member: Zeynep Buse Aydın</summary>

#### Responsibilities:
During this milestone, I served as a frontend developer, focusing on implementing and enhancing key features of our project. My primary responsibilities included designing and developing new frontend components and integrating them with backend to ensure functionality. I actively participated in reviewing and merging pull requests to maintain code quality and consistency across the project. Post-deployment, I worked on identifying and fixing bugs to improve the user experience. Throughout the milestone, I collaborated closely with team members to address technical challenges, such as resolving conflicts.

#### Main contributions:
Until Customer Milestone 2, I made significant contributions to both the technical and organizational aspects of the project. On the technical side, I implemented several key features, including the profile page and follow/unfollow functionality on the frontend. I finalized the exercise components, adding functionality for exercise creation and integrating these components with the backend. I also developed the rating functionality for exercises, although the meal ratings were deprioritized due to backend unavailability. Another significant feature I worked on was implementing leaderboards for exercises, meals, and overall performance.

In addition to new feature development, I played a vital role in resolving deployment-related bugs in collaboration with Kaan, ensuring the application ran smoothly post-deployment. I also contributed to improving the frontend user experience by enhancing the UI of exercise tracking. To maintain code quality, I wrote unit tests for the Leaderboard page and the ExerciseProgram component, and I reviewed multiple pull requests from teammates, including those for the signup/login implementation and exercise tracking UI. My reviews ensured consistency and alignment with the project’s overall goals. I also resolved a challenging conflict involving migration files by aligning my branch with the most recent main branch changes.

On the organizational side, I was responsible for scheduling team meetings, ensuring that communication and planning were well-organized. I attended every lab session and contributed to every decision made, helping drive the project forward. I also collaborated with Kaan to write the testing section of the Milestone 2 report, providing clear and comprehensive documentation of our processes. My work on the integration of the workout_program endpoint, which enables users to create exercise programs, stood out as one of the most important features in this milestone.

#### API contributions:
As a frontend developer, the most complex endpoint I used during this milestone was workout_program. This endpoint corresponds to one of our most important features which is to create an exercise program. Given the list of exercises and workout name, the exercise program is created for the user.

In this milestone, my main responsibility was developing endpoints for the backend part of the project. I created the endpoints for profile pages and some simple features and I worked on database concurrency across team members. I also reviewed some PR's of the backend team. After the completion of the backend, I actively communicated with the front-end team and handled the bugs that appeared in backend-frontend connection process. Also, after the deployment I tested the program and worked on fixing errors that occurred at the deployed environment.

#### Main contributions:
Technical part of my contributions can be divided into two parts. First part is my responsibilities which are assigned in general or backend team meetings that mostly covers the endpoint implementations. My contributions in this part are retrieving exercises from Exercises API, view and edit pages for profiles, leaderboards and following feature. Also, creating unit tests and swagger schemas can be considered under this part.

Second part of my technical contribution is solving the bugs that are faced by other teams. Most of time, I was available for frontend/mobile teams in case they have an issue while using the endpoints of backend and I was the person of contact between our teams. In this milestone, I was very active in solving the big issues of CSRF token problem which occurred during frontend connection and unresponsive endpoints problem which occurred after the deployment with Buse from frontend team. I also solved relatively small problems related to swagger and database migrations.

In the organizational part, I attended all the team meetings/labs and I was mostly active in the meetings. I was also affective in the communication between teams. Additionally, I created a visually enhanced report for unit tests of backend and added it to the testing part of the milestone report which we have created with Buse.

#### API contributions:
As a backend engineer the most complex I have created in this milestone is `view_profile`. Which gets called when a user clicks profile button or a users username from the leaderboard. The endpoint retrieves the chosen users information and returns them to the frontend, then frontend filters the information based on whether a user is accessing profile of themselves or not. 

##### Endpoint:

#### Responsibilities:

In this milestone, my core responsibilities were implementing weekly workout programs and handling the logic of tracking individual workouts inside the weekly programs, also setting the correct input and endpoints that the frontend can take. Besides that, I have also worked on optimizing other backend views functions and models like workout program, workout program creation, workout program rating, workout program bookmarking, getting all workouts of user, getting all workout logs of user, and workout program deleting. I also decided on which road we are going to use in order to keep the Activity Stream data of user in a proper way. I also reviewed other PR’s of my backend teammates. I also communicated with the frontend team in order to keep the endpoint connections to the frontend clean and understandable

#### Main contributions:
My main contributions are with the exercise program parts: I have checked every view function via postman to make sure they are compatible with the frontend, also created view functions like delete_workout_by_id, toggle_bookmark_workout, get_bookmarked_workouts, create_program, get_programs_by_username, workout_log, get_workout_logs_by_username, error_response, success_response, get_user_data,  validate_workout, validate_date. I also actively optimized and checked the other functions created by my teammates like get_workouts_by_username, get_workout_by_id, rate_workout, workout_program, get_exercises. I also reviewed and approved other works of my teammates in backend on different apps. I also worked actively on solving problems in the database migration parts.

Besides these, I attended all the team meetings/labs and participated when needed.


#### API contributions:
In the backend part, one of the complex Api’s I have created was the ‘create_program’ api. This api makes the user be able to create weekly programs and display it. In order the function to work, proper json file with the ids of workouts and days should be given in the input.

#### Responsibilities:
I worked as a mobile developer, and contributed on navigation of the pages, some backend connections and APK creation. Additionally, I did the initial re-deployment of the software to the remote machine for the new milestone, while my teammate Kaan handled the deployments done after latest fixes.

#### Main contributions:
Signup and login pages that were implemented by my teammate Nurullah were not integrated into navigation of the application, and I fixed this issue. Additionally, I partially connected the backend to the "Exercises" tab so that it can display the workouts created by that user. I also wrote unit tests for the home page that can redirect to signup and login pages.

#### API Example

##### Request

Following endpoint is used in the "Exercises" tab of the mobile app.

```
http://68.183.213.92:8000/get-workouts/?username=kaan
```

#### Response

```
[{"id": 1, "workout_name": "Kaan's Push Workout", "created_by": "kaan", "rating": 5.0, "rating_count": 2, "exercises": [{"type": "strength", "name": "Incline dumbbell bench press", "muscle": "chest", "equipment": "dumbbell", "instruction": "Lie back on an incline bench with a dumbbell in each hand atop your thighs. The palms of your hands will be facing each other. Then, using your thighs to help push the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a time so that you can hold them at shoulder width. Once you have the dumbbells raised to shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are facing away from you. This will be your starting position. Be sure to keep full control of the dumbbells at all times. Then breathe out and push the dumbbells up with your chest. Lock your arms at the top, hold for a second, and then start slowly lowering the weight. Tip Ideally, lowering the weights should take about twice as long as raising them. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions. When you are done, place the dumbbells back on your thighs and then on the floor. This is the safest manner to release the dumbbells.  Variations: You can use several angles on the incline bench if the bench you are using is adjustable. Another variation of this exercise is to perform it with the palms of the hands facing each other. Also, you can perform the exercise with the palms facing each other and then twisting the wrist as you lift the dumbbells so that at the top of the movement the palms are facing away from the body. I personally do not use this variation very often as it seems to be hard on my shoulders.", "sets": 4, "reps": 12}, {"type": "strength", "name": "Dumbbell Flyes", "muscle": "chest", "equipment": "dumbbell", "instruction": "Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell on each hand resting on top of your thighs. The palms of your hand will be facing each other. Then using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells, lift the dumbbells one at a time so you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width with the palms of your hands facing each other. Raise the dumbbells up like you're pressing them, but stop and hold just before you lock out. This will be your starting position. With a slight bend on your elbows in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon, lower your arms out at both sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Keep in mind that throughout the movement, the arms should remain stationary; the movement should only occur at the shoulder joint. Return your arms back to the starting position as you squeeze your chest muscles and breathe out. Tip: Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights. Hold for a second at the contracted position and repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.  Variations: You may want to use a palms facing forward version for different stimulation.", "sets": 3, "reps": 15}, {"type": "strength", "name": "Standing dumbbell upright row", "muscle": "traps", "equipment": "dumbbell", "instruction": "Grasp a dumbbell in each hand with a pronated (palms forward) grip that is slightly less than shoulder width. The dumbbells should be resting on top of your thighs. Your arms should be extended with a slight bend at the elbows and your back should be straight. This will be your starting position. Use your side shoulders to lift the dumbbells as you exhale. The dumbbells should be close to the body as you move it up and the elbows should drive the motion. Continue to lift them until they nearly touch your chin. Tip: Your elbows should drive the motion. As you lift the dumbbells, your elbows should always be higher than your forearms. Also, keep your torso stationary and pause for a second at the top of the movement. Lower the dumbbells back down slowly to the starting position. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: Be very careful with how much weight you use in this exercise. Too much weight leads to bad form, which in turn can cause shoulder injury. I've seen this too many times so please no jerking, swinging and cheating. Also, if you suffer from shoulder problems, you may want to stay away from upright rows and substitute by some form of lateral raises.

Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than your shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width. As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position. Pull your torso up until the bar touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar. After a second on the contracted position, start to inhale and slowly lower your torso back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched. Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.  Variations:  If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a chin assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight. Otherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help. On the other hand, more advanced lifters can add weight to the exercise by using a weight belt that allows the addition of weighted plates.

#### Responsibilities:
As a member of the mobile team, my primary responsibility is developing the mobile application by implementing new features, designing user interfaces, and adding components. I also ensure seamless integration of necessary APIs and database management functionalities in coordination with the backend team. Beyond my main duties, I contribute to the overall design and development efforts of the project, actively participate in team meetings to support decision-making processes, and fulfill tasks assigned by the team for successful project execution.

#### Main contributions:
Between Customer Milestone 1 and Customer Milestone 2, my main contributions were centered around enhancing the mobile application by adding new features, resolving bugs, improving existing functionalities, and reviewing my teammates’ work to provide feedback.

One of my key tasks was implementing a leaderboard page in the mobile app. This page allows users to view rankings based on their ratings, which are fetched from the backend. To ensure the feature worked correctly, I wrote a unit test to validate its functionality. Additionally, I added the ability to view the user's profile after clicked them in the leaderboard.

I also made significant updates to the profile page, which was initially designed by Nurullah. I enhanced it to display user information retrieved from the backend and improved its functionality so that the page's behavior dynamically adjusts depending on whether the profile being viewed belongs to the current user or another user. Additionally, I ensured that the backend endpoint for profile data was properly integrated, allowing the profile page to manage critical settings for both personal and external profiles.

Another important contribution was integrating backend functionality into the login and signup pages, also designed by Nurullah. This integration enabled users to register and log in to the app seamlessly, ensuring a smooth authentication process and full access to the app's features.

These contributions collectively strengthened the mobile app's functionality and improved the user experience, aligning the project with its goals.

#### API contributions:
I used the get_leaderboard endpoint as most complex similar to the get_workout_leaderboard and get_meal_leaderboard that are used in the same screen. This end points returns the all user's rating scores with a sorted list.

##### Endpoint: 
get_leaderboard/
##### Request Payload:
<pre>

useEffect(() => {
    const endpoints = {
      combined: baseURL + '/get_leaderboard/',
      workout: baseURL + '/get_workout_leaderboard/',
      meal: baseURL + '/get_meal_leaderboard/',
    };
    fetchLeaderboard(endpoints[activeTab]);
  }, [activeTab]);

const fetchLeaderboard = async (endpoint: string) => {
    try {
      setLoading(true);
      setError(null);
      const response = await axios.get(endpoint);
      if (response.status === 200) {
        const dataKey =
          activeTab === 'combined'
            ? 'leaderboard'
            : activeTab === 'workout'
            ? 'workout_leaderboard'
            : 'meal_leaderboard';
        setLeaderboardData(response.data[dataKey]);
      } else {
        setError('Failed to fetch leaderboard data.');
      }
    } catch (err) {
      setError('Something went wrong. Please try again later.');
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
}
