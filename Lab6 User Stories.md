### User Story 1: College Students at the Gym

Location: University Gym
Time: Early Morning (6:30 - 7:00 AM)
Duration: 15-20 minutes

**Demographics:**
A group of university students, mostly in their early 20s, who are actively interested in maintaining their fitness levels and building muscle. These students often have tight schedules due to classes, assignments, and part-time jobs, so they aim to optimize their gym sessions for efficiency. They are tech-savvy and prefer using mobile apps to track their fitness progress and find effective workout routines.

**Scenario:**
Before starting their morning workout, this group quickly checks the app to review their planned exercise programs. They look for new exercises or routines that align with their fitness goals (e.g., strength training, muscle gain, or cardio). They use the app to browse the feed for recent exercise program posts and check the leaderboard for the top-rated users.

Curious about the routines of the highest-rated users, they click on their profiles to view the exercise programs these users have created. If they find a program that fits their goals, they bookmark it for later reference. Some supermembers in this group might also share their own exercise routines, contributing to the workout database.

Additionally, they quickly check if theyâ€™ve received any comments or ratings on exercise programs they posted earlier. By the time they finish checking the app, they have a clear plan for their workout and can head directly to their exercise stations, maximizing their gym time.
