# Demo Preparation
## Scenarios
We decided on the scenarios for our presentation, focusing mostly on the leaderboard, rating, weekly exercises and exercise tracking.

## Data Population Strategy

Group members will create accounts and create posts/workouts/meals. Also, automation strategies can be used for non-originial content.

## W3C Standards
We will follow Activity Streams, today we talked on how to deal with it. We talked on to use a NoSQL database to store JSON values. We decided we will talk about our progress about it during the demo.

## Tasks
Every team (frontend, backend, and mobile) assigned tasks covering the features we decided to show during the milestone demo.

# Test Strategy
* Every endpoint will have a unit test in backend.
* Mobile and frontend will write unit tests to cover 60% of the code.

### User Test
* Exercise creation
* Meal creation
* Sign-up/Login
* Follow/unfollow
* Create Post
* Like Post
* Search 
* Edit Profile

* Bookmark/Unbookmark
* See Others' Profile

# User Experience Decisions

- We decided to take action to create similar user experience in mobile and web applications.
- We decided to make 3 leaderboards instead of 1. Three leaderboards include one for only meal ratings, one for only exercise ratings and one for both to improve user experience and enable people to choose the best in each area.
- We added weekly exercise tracking system.
