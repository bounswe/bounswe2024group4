# 12.11.2024 Lab6 report

* We started the meeting with a division of work among teams. First decision was synchronizing mobile and backend in order to create a better user experience (UX). So, mobile team was assigned to start implementing meal part inside the profile page. Web team was assigned to start implementing the workout page. Can was assigned to create the user stories. Backend team was assigned on creating a list of endpoints that need to be created.

* In terms of mobile, Nurullah created the my meals page and Ceyhun created the meal program component. Web team created exercise component and its page. Also, they started implementing the create exercise property and they added the picking muscle attribute. Mira√ß implemented exercise and exercise list components, Batuhan added the muscle selection, Buse created a page containing those items. Can created 2 user stories. Backend team created a list of endpoints and made the first assignments to members. (profile to Kaan, workout to Talha, weekly programs to Can)
